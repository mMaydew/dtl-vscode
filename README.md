## Why?
DTL is a JSON based language and highlighting would make it 10 times easier to read and work on these files outside of the Sesam platform.


## TODO:
- [x] Fill out the readme with more detail + installation instructions
- [x] Figure out the weird behaviour with function highlighting
- [x] Add highlighting for the built-in variables
- [x] Add support for single line comments
- [ ] Figure out how to implement multi line comments


## Installation:
Clone the repo into your vs code extensions folder (This is different depending on how you've installed it, best case is to search for something like `.vscode`)
This just injects itself into the `JSON with Comments` language and will highlight functions and vars (_S. _T. etc)
